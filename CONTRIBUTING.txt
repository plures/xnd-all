xnd-all is a meta package that includes the following upstream packages
as git-subtrees:

  - https://github.com/plures/ndtypes
  - https://github.com/plures/xnd
  - https://github.com/plures/gumath
  - https://github.com/plures/xndtools


xnd-all facilitates installing and testing all individual libraries with a
single build command.


The subtrees are updated when the packages are in a consistent state, usually
by @skrah for {ndtypes, xnd, gumath} and by @pearu for {xndtools}.


Preferably, pull requests should be opened for the respective upstream packages.


Working inside xnd-all
======================

Subtree changes --- the official Github Procedure
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to work on several libraries together in xnd-all, the official
GitHub procedure is this (example ndtypes+xnd):

  1) Fork xnd-all into your own account.

  2) Fork ndtypes and xnd into your own account.

  3) Do NOT update the subtrees in xnd-all. If your patch relies on upstream
     changes that haven't been merged into the subtrees, open an issue and
     reference @skrah or @pearu (see above).

  4) In your xnd-all fork, make changes to ndtypes+xnd and commit.

  5)  a) git subtree split --prefix=ndtypes --branch ndtypes
      b) git push https://github.com/user/ndtypes.git ndtypes:the-issue-fix
      c) Open a PR in ndtypes

  6)  a) git subtree split --prefix=xnd --branch xnd
      b) git push https://github.com/user/xnd.git xnd:the-issue-fix
      c) Open a PR in xnd

 
Subtree changes --- the Unix way
--------------------------------

  1) Fork xnd-all into your own account.

  2) Do NOT update the subtrees in xnd-all (see above).

  3) Make the changes and submit a PR to xnd-all. We'll download the PR as a
     good old diff and apply the changes manually to the upstream libraries.
     Naturally you will be credited in the commit messages.
